To run the code right click on tagger2.py and press run,
in line 6 of the code there is a boolean variable called pos that dictates whether we are running pos or ner (true for pos, false for ner)
the needed files should be in this hierarchy:
├── ner
│   ├── dev
│   ├── test
│   └── train
├── pos
│   ├── dev
│   ├── test
│   └── train
└── Part3
    ├── utils_part3.py
    └── tagger2.py
The code will output new files test3.ner and test1.pos (rewrite if ones already exist)
and 2 images Dev Losses {ner/pos}_part3 and Dev Accuracies {ner/pos}_part1
showing loss and accuracy over epochs.
